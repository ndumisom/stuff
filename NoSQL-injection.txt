 
NoSQL injection

Let's take a simple request (Mongodb+rails):

	User.find(:all, '$where' => "this.username.match(/#{params[:username]}/)" )

	params[:username] = "admin" => OK
	params[:username] = "admin/) || this.username.match(/.*" => NoSQL injection

Ridiculous example but this is the idea.

Just post here for the record...
